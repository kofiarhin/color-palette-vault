Generate a JSON dataset of color palettes. Each palette should have the following fields:

- id: an incremental integer
- title: short creative name (e.g., "Sunset Glow", "Ocean Breeze")
- theme: 2–3 word theme (e.g., "Warm Evening", "Coastal Calm")
- description: 1–2 sentence description of the palette
- tags: 3 descriptive lowercase keywords
- usageTips: 1 sentence practical usage suggestion
- colors: array of 4 hex color codes
- popularity: integer from 50–100

Rules:
- Create [N] unique palettes (replace [N] with the number you want).
- Mix warm, cool, neutral, pastel, dark, and vibrant themes.
- Ensure `colors` are visually coherent with the theme.
- Output only valid JSON (no explanations or extra text).
